# Introduction

-Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?

Yeah, I learned that JavaScript errors aren't as specific as maybe Ruby errors and that JS is a more liberal language (exactly what that means remains to be seen.)

-Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?

I'm a little uncomfortable with the world of computer languages. I'm still trying to piece together where exactly Ruby and JS stand when it comes to real world applications, processing speed ect. I'd also like to know how we (as programmers) got from binary code to a language like Ruby. 


# Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators 

-Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.

Similarities: Ruby and JS both take numbers, strings and booleans as basic objects. Ruby and JS both use the "!" operator to negate expressions comparisons.

Differences: JS uses a weird '==' to compare objects as well as '==='. The difference between the two isn't clear at the moment, but I know ruby only has '='' and '=='. When comparing two strings in Ruby, the string lengths are compared. JS uses capitalization to denote lesser value and symbols also have certain denoted values.


# Ch. 2: Program Structure 

-What is an expression?




-What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?




-What causes a variable to return undefined?




-Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.




-What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?




-Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.




-Describe while and for loops




-What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?




-Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.




Ch. 3: Functions (Links to an external site.) (Skip the sections on closure and recursion)
What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?
When should you use functions?
What is a function declaration?
Complete the minimum exercise in the eloquent.js file.



Ch. 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays (Links to an external site.) 
Skip the sections on the Lycanthrope's log, Computing Correlations, and sections from Further Arrayology to the Global Object, but read the chapter summary.
What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]
Create an object called me that stores your name, age, three favorite foods, and a quirk in your eloquent.js file.
What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?
Now you should be ready to face the next challenges!

If you want to continue reading this book, feel free. You can even work through the exercises, but this is the end of what you will need for this week. Work to get a basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before you dive deeper.
