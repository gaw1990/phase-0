###Release 1:
1. What does puts do? 
Puts stands for put-string. It prints the output of our code to the console and returns nil on a new line.

2. What's an integer? What's a float?
An integer is a number without decimal points(eg. 1, 2 or 65). A float is a number with decimal points after it(eg. 2.1, .99, 65.56)

3. What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division is the division we're used to. In float division, you can get fraction answers. For example 7/2 = 3.5 in float division. 

Integer division doesn't use decimals, it seems strange at first, but it's actually much more applicable to real life. For example if I have $100 I want to buy as many $15 CDs as I can, I would ask myself: What's 100/15? Float division would tell us that 100/15 is 6.666, but I can't buy .666 of a CD. 100/15 = 6 in integer division because it deals with whole numbers only.

###Release 2:
Here's some fun Ruby:

'''
    puts 24 * 365 # hours in a year
    puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 # minutes in a decade
    puts 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 25 + 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 # my age in seconds
'''

###Release 5(Excercises):
[4.2.1 Defining Variables](https://github.com/gaw1990/phase-0/blob/master/week-4/defining-variables.rb)
[4.2.2 Simple String Methods](https://github.com/gaw1990/phase-0/blob/master/week-4/simple-string.rb)
[4.2.3 Local Variables and Basic Arithmetical Operations](https://github.com/gaw1990/phase-0/blob/master/week-4/basic-math.rb)


###Release 7(Reflection):
1. How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles mathmatical operations using symbols. I'm not really sure what this question is asking. 

2. What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a whole number with no decimal points(eg. 2 or 9). A float is a number that may have decimals (eg. 2.5 or 9.0)

3. What is the difference between integer and float division?
Float division is the division we're used to. In float division, you can get fraction answers. For example 7/2 = 3.5 in float division. 

Integer division doesn't use decimals, it seems strange at first, but it's actually much more applicable to real life. For example if I have $100 I want to buy as many $15 CDs as I can, I would ask myself: What's 100/15? Float division would tell us that 100/15 is 6.666, but I can't buy .666 of a CD. 100/15 = 6 in integer division because it deals with whole numbers only.

4. What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are a class of variable that includes a series or string of characters. You would use them if you wanted to work with anything that's not an integer, float, or boolean in ruby. For example words or numbers.  

5. What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables that you can define for a session of Ruby, but that will only exist in that session. They're extremely useful becuase you can use them to store values specific to one Ruby program or to store a temporary value. 

6. How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was fine. All around pretty easy, good to get back into Ruby slowly, but surely. I forget how much fun it is!
