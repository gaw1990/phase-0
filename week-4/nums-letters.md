1. What does puts do? 
Puts stands for put-string. It prints the output of our code to the console and returns nil on a new line.

2. What's an integer? What's a float?
An integer is a number without decimal points(eg. 1, 2 or 65). A float is a number with decimal points after it(eg. 2.1, .99, 65.56)

3. What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division is the division we're used to. In float division, you can get fraction answers. For example 7/2 = 3.5 in float division. 

Integer division doesn't use decimals, it seems strange at first, but it's actually much more applicable to real life. For example if I have $100 I want to buy as many $15 CDs as I can, I would ask myself: What's 100/15. Float division would tell us that 100/15 is 6.666, but I can't buy .666 of a CD. 100/15 = 6 in integer division because it deals with whole numbers only.

'''
    puts 24 * 365 # hours in a year
    puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 # minutes in a decade
    puts 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 25 + 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 # my age in seconds
