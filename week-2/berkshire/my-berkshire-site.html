<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was fun! Everything went pretty smoothly and my partner and I dealt with problems well together. 
  Figuring out relative paths and how to insert special symbols (copyright ect.) were the only things that gave us problems and we worked through the solutions well. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	I'm not 100% sure what this question is refering to, but using the HTML5 elements I learned on CodeAcademy.com
  and other's I researched (like <hr>) wasn't so bad. The elements I've learned so far have been pretty self explanitory.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	I did well. At first I was worried about formatting and my partner was very quick to let me know that it's all 
  done in CSS. That makes a lot of sense, sort of like specialization in a factory. I also took a bit of time 
  after the pairing was over to indent my code and use whitespace, which makes a lot more sense when you're looking at and working with code.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	Good: The tag syntax is pretty simple to understand. It's definitely useful for text and pictures.
	Bad: If you want to do anything other than look at text and pictures. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	Keep an elements cheatsheet in the next tab? Other than that none that I can think of.
