		<h2>--Version Control--</h2>

		<p>When developers work on collaborative projects, it’s a challenge to keep everyone up to date with each other’s edits and saves while maintaining one bug-free and usable version. To manage these issues we use “Version Control” systems.</p>

		<p>Version control could be as simple as a college student classifying an essay as “first draft”, making edits in the margins and revising a “working draft” then polishing it up and submitting a “final draft”. The basic advantages of version control remain:</p>

		<p>1. an accessible history of edits and saves
		</p>  

		<p>2. versions that can be reverted to (if new edits don’t work)</p>

		<p>Let’s say now the next assignment is one essay to be worked on by the entire class, with separate groups working on grammar, vocabulary, formatting, and research— That’s sort of like working on a piece of software and it can get complicated.</p>

		<p>To handle these large collaborative projects, developers use systems like git and GitHub to understand the who, when and why of edits as well as keeping a central, up to date version of the project.</p>
