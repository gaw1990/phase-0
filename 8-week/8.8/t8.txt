"Where is public key crypto really needed?"
  - "It is the case that there is relatively little need for
     asymmetric key cryptography in small closed populations.
     For example, the banks get along quite well without.  The
     advantage of public key is that it permits private
     communication in a large and open population and with a
     minimum of prearrangement." [WHMurray, sci.crypt, 1994-08-
