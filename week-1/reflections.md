## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

#####If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?--
To create a repo:
1. go to github.com
2. click the big green button that says “+New Repository”
3. name your new repository, assign it as private/public, give it a readme and a license
4. click the “create repository” button and voila!

To fork a repo:
1. find the repository you want to fork on github.com
2. click the fork button on the top left and click your account picture and voila!

To clone a repo:
1. find the repository you want to clone on github.com
2. copy the clone URL from the widget on the right side of the screen
3. open your terminal and navigate to the folder you want to clone the repo to
4. type in “git clone <your url>” to pull the repo from github.com to your machine 
5. start making branches and messing around!

I would fork a repo as opposed to create a new one if I wanted to work on someone else’s project or if I wanted a similar project to base my project off of. 

#####What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

The biggest struggles I had were with getting used to working with multiple branches on git. It’s confusing because you have these parallel versions of the files and I had to jump back and forth keeping them separate in my head. Also the concept of leaving the Master branch untouched and working on separate branches seems like extra work in some scenarios, but I can also see how it is sort of a best practice. I’m still unsure how working with multiple people on one repo would flow, I feel like there’s a huge chance that one member forgets to pull and writes over someone else. It’s still a lot to wrap my head around, but I’m sure I’ll get more comfortable with git the more I use it.
